## Cover letter

Iâ€™m A 3rd year student of Chernivtsi National University, in the field of Computer Ingineering, namely computer systems and networks. Qualified in web development, database designing and computer networks. 
I`m into work, responsible, capable to be backend and frontend developer and can take responsibility to lead the projects.
  
``I am finding a junior position``,  
in company with creative and unusual ideas that I`ll implement!

First interest in programming:
During my 10th grade, I enthusiastically immersed myself in the realm of frontend web development, discovering its captivating nature. Encouraged by my teacher's acknowledgment of my skills, I embarked on a competitive journey, fueled by my passion for the craft. However, as I delved deeper into frontend development, I came to the realization that it wasn't my true calling. This prompted me to explore other programming languages and delve into backend development, attracted by its mathematical and logical intricacies. It was during this exploration that I encountered C#, a language that deeply resonated with me. Since then, my journey has been dedicated to mastering the art of backend programming, driven by my innate problem-solving abilities and unwavering commitment to excellence.
I'm learning it because I want to help a humanity and want to prove to myself that I can do everything.
