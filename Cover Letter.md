``I am finding a Python developer position``, in company with creative and unusual ideas that I`ll implement!

First interest in programming:
In 10th grade, I enthusiastically immersed myself in the world of programming. Encouraged by my teacher's recognition of my skills, I embarked on a competitive journey, eager to refine my expertise. The realization that I could implement my ideas to make the world a better place prompted me to explore more and more. Since then, I have dedicated myself to mastering the art of backend programming, driven by my problem-solving abilities and relentless pursuit of excellence. I am learning it because I want to contribute to humanity and prove to myself that I can achieve anything I set my mind to.
